# Archer_T2U
Kernel driver for T2U Wifi Stick

The driver is based on the official Archer_T2U_V1_150901 drivers. It is still not fully functional at the moment.

What works:

 * Build fix with GCC 5.x
 * Reading config files fixed - removed bogus read() functions
 * Network scan.


What doesn't works:
   * Binding to a channel.
